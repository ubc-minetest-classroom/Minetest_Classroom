tutorial.priv_table = {interact = true} -- (table) Default starting value is {interact = true}
tutorial.check_interval = 1 -- (integer or float) Seconds between checks for player position and wield
tutorial.check_pos_x_tolerance = check_interval*4 -- (integer or float) Tolerance for distance in player x position during checks; default value is the check_interval multiplied by a factor of 4 (approximately walking speed in 1 second)
tutorial.check_pos_y_tolerance = check_interval*4 -- (integer or float) Tolerance for distance in player y position during checks; default value is the check_interval multiplied by a factor of 4 (approximately walking speed in 1 second)
tutorial.check_pos_z_tolerance = check_interval*4 -- (integer or float) Tolerance for distance in player z position during checks; default value is the check_interval multiplied by a factor of 4 (approximately walking speed in 1 second)
tutorial.check_dir_tolerance = 0.01745 -- dir is given in radians, this tolerance is ~= 1 degree
